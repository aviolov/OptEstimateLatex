\abstract{This thesis poses and solves estimation and control problems
in computational neuroscience, in particular problems dealing with the
stochastic nature of neural systems. The main tool used is the description of
the system by a Fokker-Planck partial differential equation for evolution of
probability densities. 

The thesis deals with three problems in escalating degree of mathematical
sophistication and computational difficulty

The thesis focuses on developing computational schemes in order to solve the
problems. The schemes are tested for a wide range of parameters to demonstrate
their robustness}

\chapter{Introduction}
This thesis deals with problems in parameter estimation and
stochastic optimal control arising in computational neuroscience. 

Neuroscience is the study of how information is processed by living beings. Its
main building block is a single neuron cell. A neural cell maintains a certain
membrane potential, $v(t)$, an electrochemical gradient between its interior and
exterior, which is the key mechanism in which information is processed and
transmitted. For our purposed we will assume that $v$ is essentially uniform
throughout the neuron - that is we will idealize the neuron as a single point in
space. In all neural systems, information is processed and transmitted by the
sharp, transient changes in the membrane potential called spikes (TODO: see a
figure). Currently, the dominant theory is that the exact shape of the potential
excursion is irrelevant, but that all information is contained entirely in the
time occurrence of the spike or equivalently the information is in
the duration of the interval between two subsequent spikes.

There is a rich history on modelling the dynamics of the membrane potential
starting from the Nobel-prize winning work of Hodgkin and Huxley in the 50's.
Their model, still widely considered as a benchmark for the dynamics of the
membrane potential, is a 4-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE),
where one of the states is the voltage itself and the other three are phenomenological
equations describing the behaviour of ion channels responcible for the
generation of the non-linear excursion - the spike itself. There has been many
reductions of the Hodgkin and Huxley model to a smaller dimension, including the
Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and the Morris-Lecar model, which still retain the basic
excursion non-linearity of the spiking mechanism. A even-more drastic
simplification is to linearize the dynamics and then impose the non-linear
voltage excursion of the neural spike artificially. This leads to the leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) model, which
forms the foundation of all the models used in our work.

Neural cell response, especially {\sl in vivo}, is stochastic. Given the same
stimulus the resulting inter-spike intervals will not be the same. There are
several reasons and explanations for why that is. The simplest one is that in
addition to the stimulus the neuron is bombarded by extraneous, random
stimulation, for example from other neurons. To account for this random
behaviour the dynamics of the membrane potential, $v(t)$, are modelled as
following a stochastic differential equation (SDE). SDEs are a generalization
of ODEs, which allow for a stochastic force-term. 

This thesis deals with two main topics - estimation of single-cell neural models
and control of neural dynamics. Mathematically, this amounts to estimation of
parameters in SDEs and control of SDEs. A complication arising from the
practical aspects of neuroscience is that often experimentally the exact value
of the voltage is difficult to observe and it is only the spikes that are
distinctly observable. Mathematically, this implies that our estimation
and control algorithms will often be based on observation of {\sl first
passage} times of the system rather than detailed trajectories. This makes the problem
significantly more challenging and requires some non-standard
algorithms. At the same time, the study of First-Passage Times (FPTs) is a
classic part of Stochastic Analysis and there are many known
techniques and results that we can build on.

The three problems that are discussed in this thesis can be summarized as
such: in the first problem, we estimate parameters from spike observations; 
in the second, we discuss how to control a neuron to spike at some pre-selected
time; and in the third problem, we combine both approaches whereas we
control the system in order to best estimate its parameters.

The thesis is structured as follows: First, in \cref{ch:math_background} we
introduce the mathematical background from stochastic processes, parameter
estimation and optimal control used in the rest of the thesis; in
\cref{sec:math_models_in_neuroscience} we discuss the standard stochastic models
of a single neuron. The next three chapters,
\cref{ch:estimate,ch:spike_control,ch:optimal_design} form the novel portion of
this thesis where we discuss each of the three problems introduced above. These
three chapters have been adapted from journal papers either accepted for
publication or currently in review. \Cref{ch:estimate} has been published in
TODO: (cite it); \cref{ch:spike_control} has been submitted in TODO: (cite it);
and \cref{ch:optimal_design} is being prepared for submission at \ldots.
Although the journal articles form the foundation of the chapters, each chapter
has been rewritten to achieve a uniform notation and to fit into the overall
flow of the thesis.

In the Conclusion, \cref{ch:conclusion}, we summarize the main findings and
provide a brief outlook.

\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{ch:conclusion}
Ah, la conclusion:-) 
TODO:

In the first task, of estimating, one can see that there remains one interesting
problem, and that is why the estimation quality degrades with higher sinusoidal
frequency in particular for one of the two methods (the
Fokker-Planck / Likelihood based method).

In the second task, the possible avenues for progress are much broader\ldots 

The third task\ldots . 

Hopefully, this can be applicable to more complex areas of neuroscience and
physiology, where the systems under study are quite amenable to direct external
perturbation.
